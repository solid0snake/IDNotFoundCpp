# ID Not Found Cpp
<h6>
Test of exception handling by looking for a product's ID triggering the exception if the ID is not found.
This program uses two arrays, one to store products and another to store product ID's. The function getProductID takes as input the two arrays, the length of the arrays, and a target product to search for. It then loops through the product name array and if a match is found it returns the corresponding product ID.</h6>
